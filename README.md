# DA_files
Here all the analysis files are uploaded, whatever I have done during my practice.
One file is Power BI visualization file which I have done the project during learning.
Other .ipynb extension are Python projects relevant. There used libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn majorly. 
Also used sklearn for scientific purpose.
Pandas used for Data Manipulations, Numpy used for working with arrays, Matplotlib and Seaborn both are used for pltting graphs.
